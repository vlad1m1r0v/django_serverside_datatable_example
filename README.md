## **Django Server-side Datatable Example**

A simple example of how you can use the Datatables.net library with Django, implementing server-side processing using the django-ajax-datatable library.

## **Features**

1. List Countries: Display a paginated list of countries.

2. Sorting: Order countries by Population, Area, and GDP in ascending or descending order.

3. Filtering: Filter the list by country name.

4. Editing: Update country data by clicking on the "Update" button or anywhere on the row.

5. Deletion: Delete a record via an AJAX call. A confirmation modal appears before deletion, and upon success, a toast message confirms the action.
